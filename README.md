Traffic Flow Prediction with LSTM
Predicting short-term traffic speeds on LA highways using deep learning (LSTM networks) and the widely used METR-LA dataset.​

📍 Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for traffic speed forecasting:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: Automated handling of METR-LA data

LSTM Model Training: Two-layer deep sequence model

Evaluation: MAE and RMSE on test set, visual sample predictions

Outputs: Trained model saved, results and error analysis illustrated

This project provides a robust, reproducible LSTM baseline for time-series traffic forecasting—ideal for research, learning, and extension.

📦 Dataset
Name: METR-LA (Metropolitan Los Angeles Traffic)
