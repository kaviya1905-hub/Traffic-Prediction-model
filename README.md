# Dataset Details
Source: METR-LA public dataset â€“ traffic speed readings from 207 LA highway sensors, 34,272 timesteps.
Format: HDF5 file (`METR-LA.h5`), loaded as a DataFrame.
Usage:  Example uses the first sensor for univariate LSTM modeling (edit for multivariate support).

# Trained Model File
- Final trained model is saved as:  

**`traffic\_lstm\_model.pth`**

# Model & Preprocessing Explanation
Model architecture: 
-A two-layer LSTM with 64 hidden units was chosen due to its effectiveness at modeling time-series data with sequential dependencies, such as traffic. LSTMs handle long-range temporal relationships and are widely used in traffic forecasting research.

Preprocessing:  
-Data loaded and converted to a scaled \[0,1] range for stable training (using MinMaxScaler).
- Time-series windowing: For each prediction, the last 12 five-minute readings predict the next 12 readings (1 hour ahead).
- (No explicit augmentation, as time-series usually do not use classic image/data augmentations.)

Interpretation of Performance:  
- The training loss falls and plateaus quickly, indicating good convergence.
- MAE and RMSE are reasonable for basic univariate prediction.
- Sample prediction plots show the LSTM can track the general trend, but greater accuracy may be reached by using more complex models, more sensors, or additional features.

Strengths:
-Simple pipeline, reproducible results, interpretable error plots, good baseline for upgrades.

Weaknesses:
-Univariate; real-world scenarios need more features, richer architectures (TCN, GNN) for noisy or highly variable data.
